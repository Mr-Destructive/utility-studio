## About

### Description

A place for quick and easy access to tasks like document, video, and text summarizing. Users can quickly come and drop their documents, youtube links, text, and web links and generate/extract textual information.


#### Tech Stack

  The Utility Studio is built on a Refine (Next.js) project, leveraging the power of server-side rendering and React components for a smooth user experience. It integrates with Appwrite, a backend serverless platform, to handle various functionalities.

- Refine
- Next JS
- Appwrite (storage and functions)
- Python (cloud functions)
- Material UI

2. Create a project and name it whatever you like, I have chosen `utility-studio-test` so choose a different one.
3. From the appwrite [cli](https://appwrite.io/docs/command-line), deploy the functions with `appwrite deploy function`.
4. Create buckets for `audio`, `video`, and `document` storage.
5. Grab the token keys for the web platform and configure them as the environment variables.
6. Create the `.env` file and paste all the credentials as mentioned in the `sample.env` file.
